ClientServer Storage Project SRS Evaluation
===========================================

Nice job on this, very detailed.

Some suggestions.

First of all, you don't need to specify anything about how the project
is built.  All the information about compiling and so on is good to have,
just not in THIS document.

Second, you want to try to focus on WHAT your application is doing, not
the HOW of how it is doing it.  You would say "the server shall start up
using a command from the command line".  You would say, "the server shall
start on an available port" which is followed by a "will" statement that
says what the server's default port is.

Third, you want to specify things like 5.2.1.3 using a bit more detail;
you say store files in a designated directory, but you don't say what
the directory is, or specify the method that is supplied to the user for
making that selection.  Is it a button?  Is it a dialog box?  Is it a
file chooser window?  Is it specified from the server at startup on the
command line, or is it something that is an option in the client?

I think you see the thrust of these arguments....

To save you time, since we are already nearly 1/2 way through the semester,
you don't have to do anything further with this document if you don't feel
the need to do so.  I just want you to have the same heads-up as the rest
of the class, since you weren't in my 401 class, so that you know what the
proper form and function of the SRS is.

Deliverable D-02: 15% out of 15% = 100% which is an A-plus
Deliverable D-05:  5% out of  5% = 100% which is an A-plus

Keep up the good work!
